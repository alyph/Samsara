## Pillars

### Perspective
- Play an interstellar empire as a whole, beyond individuals, factions or government. Actions can be instigated by the states, the private sectors as well as characters, however the actions can also go against each individual officials, civillians or the government itself

### Exploration
- Discover a weird universe: flora and fauna, ruins and remnants, planets and stars, worlds and dimensions, unique resource, biomes, architecture, culture, society and characters, uncover the alternate reality, laws of physics and the mysteries of cosmos
- The discoveries can lead to quests, expeditions and personal pursuit
- All found natural and artificial features should be displayed and can be observed on the worlds, characters, ships and any other entities, wonders and interesting events can be admired and beholden
- A variety of population types exist in various worlds, classes, jobs, cultures, religions, tech levels should all be represented 

### Development
- Construct large scale facilities with deep resource chain and upgrade path
- All about numbers going up! combo and multiplicative effects
- All development projects should be randomly and procedurely provided instead of available all the time
- Awe inspiring wonders and space projects
- Colonization and terraforming
- Unique and imaginative trade goods and resources that can be exploited by facilities and buildings as well as bring benefit and side effects to the society
- Research and technology progresses naturally but certain focused research projects may be conducted directly via randomly generated proposals
- Hands off trading but can be influenced and attracted by development
- Small and mundane buildings, structures and infrastructures should be developed based on simulation without direct control but may be indirectly influenced

### Politics
- Manage relationship and conflicts between species, races, nations, factions, organizations, classes and demographic groups
- Political ideas and social, cultural phenomenon will emerge by simulation. Events, decisions, debates, crisis and policies can take place accordingly
- Covert actions, espionage, secret dealings, secret societies, political intrigues

### Military
- Large scale operations: intergalactic wars, invasions
- Small scale operations: rescue missions in alien worlds, convoy missions, xeno purge
- Theater and operational level command, tactics play out by simulation
- Military build up, expansion and upgrade should be decision and event based, not constant actions
- Military operations are the results and extensions of quests, expeditions and political actions 


## Mechanics

### Economic Model
- overall development
  - population
  - infrustructure, housing, sanitation, health, leisure
  - more income
  - more building slots
  - higher production and demand
- agricultural/rural development
  - including farming, minding, wood cutting, hunting and any other resource gathering activities
  - rural population and infrustructure
  - raw resource gathering, food, material production
- commerce level
  - merchant population
  - trade infrustructure, market, ports, werehouse, trading post, banks, guilds, roads, ships
  - more income
  - more trade power
- industrial level
  - worker, craftsman, blacksmith, mason, carpenter, population
  - industrial infrustructure, workshop, factory, manufacturer
  - consumes raw goods and produce manufactured goods
  - accelerates infrustructural build up
  - providing tools for other fields (e.g. agriculture, mining)
- cultural level
  - population involved in academic/scientific research, philosophic/religious/social study, art creation etc.
  - facilities supporting these actiities, schools, monesteries, temples, theatres
  - generating culture and research points which (together with the technology points from pratical work) eventually lead to discoveries
- military level
  - population that serves in regular military force, or can be potentially drafted (e.g. levy)
  - military infrustructure, barracks, training camp, arsenel, supply depot
  - provide more manpower, and better quality fighting force
  - also providing more war equipment, warships
- wealthiness
  - population generally split into rich, middle, poor wealthiness classes
  - each of these classes also have different wealthiness level compared to other areas, certain area's middle class may be wealthier than other area's rich class
  - wealth is a key indicator of a good economy (note wealth is measure in a general absolute value, not entirely based on volatile currency value), it provide the following benefits
    - higher income
    - attract more trade goods (but also demand more, so if certain resource becomes scarce, it can drain the wealth quickly)
    - faster development of infrusturcture
    - leads to more cultural development, grander facilities and more sophisticated architecture and decorations
    - better quality of military (especially for drafted, self serving armies)
  - one downside of wealthiness is it can eventually lead to decadence due to long term life indulgement 
    - decadence will become a counter force to cultural and scientific development, slow down innovations
    - in general the goal is to improve wealth but in the meantime utilize ways to counter decadence, and when necessary break down the wealth with extreme means like wars or revolutions

### Province Stats

- development/infrustructure/population
- urbanization
- city planning (common city facilities, public bath, taven, aqueduct, roads)
- architecture
- dietry
- rural/agricultural development
- commerce
- industry
- culture
- military
- wealth
- decadence
- goods consumed
- goods produced
- demography
  - class, culture, religion, origin, language
- technology
- public health and sanitation
- satisfaction, happiness
  - different demographic groups have different needs and desires
  - this is to measure how each of their needs are satisfied
- order/disorder


### Action Mechanics
- Option A: limited ongoing actions, pick new action when there is empty action slot. events don't count towards action limit
- Option B: pick new action(s) every fixed number of turns, do not have hard action limit but may apply soft limit, certain actions may be instantanous and do not take action slots
- Option C: no centralized action selection list, each category will prompt action selection by itself, e.g. when builds complete, pop up to select new building

### Missions
- mission can originate from ruler's ambition, which may be persistent for aspiring rulers, which will stay in the agenda, and players can select exact direction which forms the mission (e.g. conqure land, build prosperous land) (or maybe it doesn't transform into but generate the new actions, the ambition stays there until proper conditions are met and can occationally provide aid to those actions), those by itself will transform into different actions and once complete it will go back to form new missions
- ruling classes (e.g. council, senate etc.) can also propose directional missions, which will show up in the mission list, these are not persistent and must be picked within the time limit
- the bigger missions of the game are the legacies which are meta challenges similar to achievements (more for meta progression and game mode specifics)
- there is also smaller missions like bring properity to a city, which act like a side plot line which bring some speical actions and trigger events

### Stats

Quantitative values associated with each entity. The entities can be stars, systems, planets, cities, settlements, population, characters, fleets, ships, equipment etc.

### Traits 

Traits are qualitative tags associated with the each entity. Which mainly describe the following:
- characteristics 
- ongoing status and events
- historic background and past experience

### Actions

Actions are what players actively pursue. 
- There is a limited number of slots for active actions
- When there is vacant slot, a new action can be chosen among a pool of available actions
- Actions in the pool are drafted randomly but also based on a set of rules. e.g. must meet prerequisites
- Certain categories of actions are always available. e.g. development, research projects
- During the process of an action, additional incidents or situations may arise and require player to make decisions. e.g. encounters during survey missions or select which ship prototype to go into production
- Non-player factions may also perform actions but may follow different rules. e.g. opponent factions, your vassels, your governers, corporations may all perform their own actions with different limitations

Examples of actions:
- Survey missions
- Colonization missions
- Development, building projects - likely randomly draft several proposals
- Research projects - similarly draft proposals
- Expeditions/quests - based on the discoveries of survey missions, character requests/interactions, events etc.
- Found orgnizations: corporations, agencies, cults, religions
- Upgrade fleet/army equipment
- Expand military force, create new fleet
- Enact policies and laws
- Political actions, coup, assasinations, overthrow government
- Diplomatic actions, meetings, incidents, war preparations
- Military campaigns

### Events

Events are basically actions. The difference is events emerge without player instigation and they are not subject to the action slot limit
- There are a lot of events going on in the worlds at any given time, but most of them are small or mundane and those are represented by traits. Only the prominent events that require deeper player involvement and attention will be represented by the events here. However smaller events may evolve into bigger ones if not taken care of properly
- Events may evolve into something just like actions and those will be played out like actions. e.g. when a conflict escalated into all out war or other factions declare war, the events will simply turn into a military campaign (in practice, this may be a switch from one event to another)

Examples of events:
- Border conflicts and frictions
- Rebellion, unrest, secession
- Trade dispute
- Diplomatic actions initiated by non-player factions
- External threat: alien invasions, sudden rise of power
- Emerge of religious or political power
- Cultural or political movement
