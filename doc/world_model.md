### Locations

world > region > territory

#### World

Habitable astronomical bodies, usually are planets. But can be other things like artificial body (like ring world, dyson sphere, but wouldn't be small objects like space stations which are tethered to worlds). Worlds can also be other less common locations like asteroid belt or more strange ones like paralelle worlds, outer dimensional worlds, virtual worlds

Example: Earth, Mars

#### Region

Regions are large geographical locations in a world. They are divided based on geographical boundaries and are relatively stable. Their names may change throughout the history

Example: Western Europe, North America, East Asia, Outer Space, Subterranean Land (where space stations are located)

#### Territory

Territories are smaller areas in each region. They are either divided via geographical or political boundaries, relatively dynamic. Territories can split and merge throughout the history, and not all area in a regions are represented by territories, only ones relevant to inhabitants are marked as territories. Territories are not usually visible to players, and only internally tracked by the simulation. The cities and facilities in the territories however can be managed and observed by the players

Example: Tokyo, California, Normandy, Space station

#### City

Most of the populous territories will have their predominant cities and some territories are entirely cities (e.g. metropolis). Each world will have a top list of cities
