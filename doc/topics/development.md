### Design considerations

#### another idea

another idea is not having development just industry per goods and services so you have one industry aimed at one goods or service


### Development

- development is an abstraction of infrastructures, facilities, institutions and logistics supporting a type of human and social activities (e.g. farming, mining, crafting, trading, education, religious activities)
- development requires population to work and support it and also providing working positions for the population
- development grows by the needs and desires of the population as well as driven by the market based on supply and demand
- development (when active) will produce goods and services


### Growth

The growth of a development type involves the following:
- The demand for the goods and services this development produces
- The workforce of the given development (shortage vs. oversupply)
- The investment, management and other involvement from upper classes
