#### realm

- realm is what a player represents
  - Q: can there ever be AI controlled realms?
  - a realm usually have a theme (e.g. Roman empire, kingdom of France, crusade states, Taifa states, Mongol hordes)
  - there can be war among states in the same realm (they are not always friends, and can become enemies time to time) and civil wars are very common as well
- a realm indirectly connects to states, factions and characters based on various factors
  - each states have rating of how closely they are tied to the realm (e.g. vassels are farther but still tied)
  - conquired territories gradually become closer to the realm
  - other factions (e.g. merchants, churches) can also become close to the realm when they are based off the territory within the realm
- actions/events can then be played on states, factions, cities and characters that are tied to the realm
  - each of those will cost some resource (e.g. administrative power, military power, engineering ideas etc.)
  - these resources are generated based on simulations, and portion of those are accumulated and can be spent to play actions/events. the propotion is determined by how close they are tied to the realm. The remaining portion are accumulated for use of their own, to play randomly drawn events
- other than naturally growing ties with the realm, players have options to manipulate that
  - players can assign primary states to the realm, which can have strongest tie
  - in certain special events, players can bring outside factions into the realm (even the invaders)
- there are events that can be played on targets outside of the realm
  - but those usually cost destiny points


#### missions and legacies

- there are various missions that a realm can undertake
  - some are unique to certain realms in certain geo location or culture
- fullfilled missions grants various benefits and sometimes gain more destiny points
- certain missions are considered as legacies, these are the goals of the game
  - acomplished legacies gives greater benefits and meta benefits for future runs, as well as unlocking certain scenarios and other game elements
- a lot of missions and legacies are materialized into ambitions of a state or character
  - ambitions can provide special actions/events (e.g. for conquest ambition, a campaign action is always available, together with more recruitment options)
  - ambitions are automatically terminated when the related character or states cease to exist


#### destiny points

- destiny points are used in power actions and events that alter the trajectory of the history
  - these events are usually considered as occur by random chance
  - think these as divine intervention
- destiny points come from many sources
  - complete missions and legacies
  - fullfill certain conditions (e.g. controlling Jerusalem rewards you destiny points each turn)
  - having legendary rulers or characters
  - major technological breakthrough, changing of eras


#### game ending coniditons

- a realm has a few strikes (like a character's HP) before it goes down in flame
  - it's almost always going down and rarely healed back
  - it's just a matter of time before a realm gets all strikes
- a realm can get a strike for many reasons
  - disastrous events (e.g. major state's capitol occupied by invading forces, ruler died without an heir)
  - realm engulfed in turmoil (too many internal and external wars for too long, or simply a measure of very low stability for long time)
  - realm falls into decadence
  - failed revolution or revolt (player instigated)
  - realm dwindled (e.g. territory shrinks to a single city and not able to expand within set number of turns)
