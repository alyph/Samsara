#### various aspects in the medieval world

- each lords or vassals may have their own opinion of the opponents and enemies, some may sympathize with them or consider them as too strong, thus reluctant to go to war against them
  - we should be able to inspect this info and take that into considerations when go to war
  - these lords may hinder the war effort either oppose the war plan or do not provide sufficient support (levies or money)
  - when the campaign goes south they are also the first to complain and abandon the post
- the local people sometimes also have a say in the conflicts, whether they support the expansion or rather tend to their land peacefully can affect the grand scheme of things. These local people usually hold some level of power, e.g. local minor lords or aristocracies
- seizing the trade route is sometimes an important strategic objective of a war
  - you can profit from establishing or gaining control of certain trade routes
  - but you can also lose the benefit if you lose key settlements along the trade routes to enemies
- when a state or faction is threatened they may seek outside help. e.g. a rebel broke out against a weak king, the king may bring in help from other countries which may actually be unwanted from player's perspective and weaken the player's grasp on his own country
- sometimes you need a certain authority figure to push for certain agenda (e.g. a military campaign). if the local lords are not united, then maybe outside figure like a envoy sent from pope (e.g. a legate) may help
- before a major war effort, it is wise to gain as much support as possible, both internal and external
