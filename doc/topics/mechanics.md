### card, deck and hand management

The goal of a card and deck system is as follows:
1. to reduce the decision space. instead of providing all options to the players at the same time, provide only a subset of those and focus on the choice among the limited set
2. to not completely dominate player decisions and agencies with random chances. e.g. players are not simply playing out whatever actions (cards) that are dealt to them


A few design choices to consider
- draft a larger hand, but only allow to play some of them and must discard the rest
- allow players to pay some cost to bank the card that they can play in the future (e.g. added to the persistent hand)
- provide the options to pay to draw and play (or bank) more cards
- provide some standard actions that can always be played and some with low or no cost
