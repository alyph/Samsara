### card, deck and hand management

The goal of a card and deck system is as follows:
1. to reduce the decision space. instead of providing all options to the players at the same time, provide only a subset of those and focus on the choice among the limited set
2. to not completely dominate player decisions and agencies with random chances. e.g. players are not simply playing out whatever actions (cards) that are dealt to them
3. have the excitement of drawing rare cards. for example, for projects and units cards, we need have some high level cards that gradually unlock and has lower chance to draw


A few design choices to consider
- draft a larger hand, but only allow to play some of them and must discard the rest
- allow players to pay some cost to bank the card that they can play in the future (e.g. added to the persistent hand)
- provide the options to pay to draw and play (or bank) more cards
- provide some standard actions that can always be played and some with low or no cost


other things to consider:
- cards handle the actions originated from your own realm very well, but it may not be suitable for reactions to events in other countries and factions. For example, if a new ruler who has weak claims may be an opportunity for exerting your influence or even plan for an invasion. but you may not have the right card for the job and by the time you get the card the opportunity may have slipped away, or you are holding on to that card then the opportunity may not show up. in this case, maybe a regular action letting you poke into other states' affairs may be useful? or another way is to let you draw the specific card you want with the cost of some destiny points


types of cards
- events
  - major events that occurred through out the history
  - other names: story, episode, chapter, record, memoir, account, narrative, tale
- regular actions
- projects
- unit recruitment
- stratagems
- innovations


rules:
- every year (4 turns) draft 2 cards (among a few more cards, 5?) and add to the hand
  - the point here is if all you use is the card in your hand, eventually they will run out (you need at least 4 cards per year)
- every season (1 turn) draw 2 regular action cards and 2 other ephemera cards (you can pick one action from them, but they disappear after the turn no matter what)
- regular actions normally give you chance to add more cards to your hand (and specific to certain categories or tags)
