### Population

aspects of population:
- social class, strata and status (upper, middle, lower, noble, commoner...)
- ethnic group? (cultural, origin, religion, race?)
- economic status, wealth, income
- happiness, likes, dislikes, state of the mind
- education
- health conditions

population applies to these functions:
- creates "want" of goods and services, in turn creates demand on the market
- (mostly mid, lower classes) provides work force and labor for developments
- (mostly upper classes) provides investment, management and encouragement? to the developments
- depending on culture, religion and various other factors may provide buffs and debuffs to develoopment that they are involved in as well as cities or even nations at larger scale
