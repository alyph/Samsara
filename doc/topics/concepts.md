#### culture, technology, innovations

- these are tied to locations (specifically the cities)
- even though cultural norms and traditions are more or less carried over through generations of same cultural groups and ethnics, they are heavily influenced by where people live and what other people they have in contact
- when people migrate, colonize and conqure they bring their customs to new land, and trading and other contact also spread culture to other places and among other people
- through contact and conflicts cultures are intermingled and constantly changing and shifting
- adoptations of religions are some of the faster form of culture shift, a large amount of customs, practices, standards can be brought into the cultural fold in mere years.
- cultural norms are something that takes long time to form but also harder to change. people will carry them whereever they go and become their identity
- ideas and innovations can emerge quick and spread fast and easily adopted through communications, eventually those will transform and become cultural norm over long period of time


#### civics

- policies and ideas that affect the entire state (and even the vassels to some extent)



#### local edicts and policies

- affect the local city
