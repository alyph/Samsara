#### estate

- estates represent various social classes
- estates are the primary entities that hold political power and economic wealth in private sectors
- the states and government can represent certain estates (e.g. royal court and kingdom represents the nobel classes) but they are treated separately, and they are usually the minority among their represented estates
- with that you have the dynamics between the assets, power, and wealth controlled by the states and state heads (e.g. kings, dukes, bishops) and that controlled by the private (e.g. nobles, clergies, merchants, commoners and peasants), the balance between states and each of the estates shapes how the society functions
- further in, each estate consists of several population groups each with their distinctive race, culture, and religions
