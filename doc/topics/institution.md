#### institution

- institutions in game represents all government, religious, political, military, civil organizations and collectives. 
  - e.g. kingoms, duchies, church, knights orders, monastic orders, mercenary companies, peasant rebellions, merchant guild, banks, political parties etc.
- states are a special form of institutions, and they are essentially government, owning lands and cities.
  - note, churches and military orders etc. can own cities, and serving governmental purpose as well, so they can represent states as well (e.g. papal state)
  - second thought: maybe being a state and owning cities is a concept orthogonal to the concept of institutions, meaning any institution can perform as a state
  - states should be compared against the private sectors (e.g. different estates within the society)
