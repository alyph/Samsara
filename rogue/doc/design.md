## Pillars

### Exploration
- Discover a weird universe: flora and fauna, ruins and remnants, planets and stars, worlds and dimensions, unique resource, biomes, architecture, culture, society and characters, uncover the alternate reality, laws of physics and the mysteries of cosmos
- The discoveries can lead to quests, expeditions and personal pursuit

### Development
- Construct large scale facilities with deep resource chain and upgrade path
- All development projects should be randomly and procedurely provided instead of available all the time
- Awe inspiring wonders and space projects
- Colonization and terraforming
- Unique and imaginative trade goods and resources that can be exploited by facilities and buildings as well as bring benefit and side effects to the society
- Research and technology progresses naturally but certain focused research projects may be conducted directly via randomly generated proposals
- Hands off trading but can be influenced and attracted by development
- Small and mundane buildings, structures and infrastructures should be developed based on simulation without direct control but may be indirectly influenced

### Politics
- Manage relationship and conflicts between spices, races, nations, factions, organizations, classes and demographic groups
- Political ideas and social, cultural phenomenon will emerge by simulation. Events, decisions, debates, crisis and policies can take place accordingly
- Covert actions, espionage, secret dealings, secret societies

### Military
- Large scale operations: intergalactic wars, invasions
- Small scale operations: rescue missions in alien worlds, convoy missions, xeno purge
- Theater and operational level command, tactics play out by simulation
- Military build up, expansion and upgrade should be decision and event based, not constant actions
- Military operations are the results and extensions of quests, expeditions and political actions 


## Mechanics

### Stats

Quantitative values associated with each entity. The entities can be stars, systems, planets, cities, settlements, population, characters, fleets, ships, equipment etc.

### Traits 

Traits are qualitative tags associated with the each entity. Which mainly describe the following:
- characteristics 
- ongoing status and events
- historic background and past experience

### Actions

Actions are what players actively pursue. 
- There is a limited number of slots for active actions
- When there is vacant slot, a new action can be chosen among a pool of available actions
- Actions in the pool are drafted randomly but also based on a set of rules. e.g. must meet prerequisites
- Certain categories of actions are always available. e.g. development, research projects
- During the process of an action, additional incidents or situations may arise and require player to make decisions. e.g. encounters during survey missions or select which ship prototype to go into production
- Non-player factions may also perform actions but may follow different rules. e.g. opponent factions, your vassels, your governers, corporations may all perform their own actions with different limitations

Examples of actions:
- Survey missions
- Colonization missions
- Development, building projects - likely randomly draft several proposals
- Research projects - similarly draft proposals
- Expeditions/quests - based on the discoveries of survey missions, character requests/interactions, events etc.
- Found orgnizations: corporations, agencies, cults, religions
- Upgrade fleet/army equipment
- Expand military force
- Pass policies and laws
- Political actions, coup, assasinations, change of government
- Diplomatic actions, meetings, incidents, war preparations
- Military campaigns

### Events

Events are basically actions. The difference is events emerge without player instigation and they are not subject to the action slot limit
- There are a lot of events going on in the worlds at any given time, but most of them are small or mundane and those are represented by traits. Only the prominent events that require deeper player involvement and attention will be represented by the events here. However smaller events may evolve into bigger ones if not taken care of properly
- Events may evolve to something just like actions and those will be played out like actions. e.g. when a conflict escalated into all out war or other factions declare war, the events will simply turn into a military campaign

Examples of events:
- Border conflicts and frictions
- Rebellion, unrest
- Trade dispute
- Diplomatic actions initiated by other factions
- External threat: alien invasions, sudden rise of power
